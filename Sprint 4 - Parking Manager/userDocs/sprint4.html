          For this fourth sprint, the initial logical architecture is:
          <p align="center"><a href="./img/legenda.png">Legenda</a></p>
          <div class="interactions__image">
            <center>

            </center>
          </div>
          <br><br>
          This sprint will be focused on the <b>Parking Manager</b> actions. So it will cover the entire Park Manager System. It will also provide a Park Service Status GUI.
          <br>
          We refer to "<b>Business Logic***</b>" as the remaining part of the Business Logic that does not involve the transport trolley actor, the Indoor/Outdoor Controller actors, the Parking Slot Controller actor and the Park Service actor.
          <br>

          <h4 id="introductions">Introduction</h4>
          <div>
            For Parking Manager actions we intend:
            <ul>
              <li>the monitoring of the entire system;</li>
              <li>the start/stop of the transport trolley;</li>
              <li>the handling of the fan, based on the temperature measured;</li>
              <li>the handling of the alarms notified.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3 id="thermometer-analysis">Thermometer Analysis</h3>
          <div>
            The task of the thermometer is to measure the temperature inside the parking area to understand:
            <ul>
              <li>if the temperature is higher or lower than the configurable threshold <b>TMAX</b>;</li>
            </ul>
            From the requirements <b>the thermometer is virtual</b>, but to increase the utility of the PMS, it would be appropriate to let the system <b>configurable</b> in order to choose between a virtual or real thermometer. In this sprint, we focus on the <b>virtual thermometer</b>.
            <br><br>
            In the case of a virtual thermometer, it is necessary to <b>have a 'mock' interface</b> that allows you to check and modify the value of the temperature at any time.
            <br><br>
            It was also decided to <b>insert no logic inside the thermometer</b> in order to make it as reusable as possible: the thermometer is therefore limited only and exclusively to measure the temperature.
            <br><br>
            The thermometer is model as a <k>QActor</k>. It should be notified about the current temperature via a proper <k>input_temperature</k> dispatch independently from the underlying virtual or real configuration.
            <br>
            <h4>Observable State</h4>
            <div>
              After a careful analysis, it was decided to make the thermometer an <a href="#observation-analysis">observable entity</a>; in particular the thermometer QActor exposes in its observable status the information about the current temperature measured in the parking area. <br>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3 id="thermometer-filter-analysis">Thermometer Filter</h3>
          <div>
            Considering the absence of logic within the thermometer qactor, it is necessary to have within the domain logic an entity in charge of checking whether the temperature measured at each instant is greater than the TMAX threshold.
            <br>
            For these reasons, we introduce the <b>Thermometer Filter</b>. An entity that is responsible for <tt>observing</tt> the temperature measured by the thermometer and checking every time a new temperature is measured whether or not it exceeds the TMAX threshold.
            <br><br>
            Despite the weight sensor/out sonar observation made by the Indoor/Outdoor Controller, the Thermometer Filter observes the Thermometer continuously, since the manager should be notified any time the temperature measured is greater or lower than TMAX, to take the necessary actions for the correct functioning of the system (e.g. power on/off the fan, stop/start the transport trolley).
            <br>
            The Thermometer Filter is model as a <k>QActor</k>.
            <br>
            <h4>Startup Configuration</h4>
            <div>
              At each system's boot there is the need to let the Thermometer Filter aware of some parameters, like:
              <ul>
                <li><b>TMAX</b>: temperature threshold which, if exceeded, means that the temperature is too high.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Observable State</h4>
            <div>
              After a careful analysis, it was decided to make the thermometer filter an <a href="#observation-analysis">observable entity</a>; in particular the thermometer filter QActor exposes in its observable status the information about whether or not the TMAX threshold is exceeded (in boolean form). <br>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3 id="fan-analysis">Fan Analysis</h3>
          <div>
            The task of the fan is to lower the parking area temperature when it exceeds the TMAX threshold.
            <br><br>
            From the requirements and as already said in the <a href="../../First%20Problem%20Analysis/userDocs/First%20Problem%20Analysis.html#fan">first problem analysis</a>, the fan can be manual or automatic. In the first case, it should be activated by the manager through the Park Service Status GUI, while in the second case it is up to the system to activate the fan at the appropriate time, that is, when the temperature measured by the thermometer is greater than TMAX.
            <br><br>
            From the requirements <b>the fan is virtual</b>, but to increase the utility of the PMS, it would be appropriate to let the system <b>configurable</b> in order to choose between a virtual or real fan. In this sprint, we focus on the <b>virtual fan</b>.
            <br><br>
            It was also decided to <b>insert no logic inside the fan</b> in order to make it as reusable as possible: the fan is therefore limited only and exclusively to be powered on or off.
            <br><br>
            The fan is model as a <k>QActor</k>. It should be activated or disactivated via a proper <k>fan_on</k> or <k>fan_off</k> request independently from the underlying virtual or real configuration. The outcome of this operation is given by the answer <k>fan_done</k> or <k>fan_fail</k>.
          </div>

          <h3 id="fan-controller-analysis">Fan Controller</h3>
          <div>
            Considering the absence of logic in the fan qactor, it is necessary to have within the domain logic an entity responsible for setting the fan in manual or automatic mode and adopting different behaviors depending on the mode set.
            <br><br>
            The Fan Controller is modeled as a <k>QActor</k>. It should be set in automatic/manual mode via a proper <k>manager_fan_automatic_mode</k> or <k>manager_fan_manual_mode</k> dispatch.
            <br>
            The two modes are mutually exclusive.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>In case of <b>manual mode</b>, the fan controller should be able to receive the power on/off command via a proper <k>manager_fan_on</k>/<k>manager_fan_off</k> dispatch.</li>
              <li>In case of <b>automatic mode</b>, the fan controller should be able to <b>observe the Thermometer Filter</b> to understand when is the right time to turn the fan on or off, based on the information exposed by the Thermometer Filter itself. (e.g. when the Thermometer Filter status changes, a proper command should be sent to the fan by the Fan Controller).</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            In both modes (manual or automatic), the fan controller should be able to communicate with the fan via the right request/response mode.
            <h4>Observable State</h4>
            <div>
              After a careful analysis, it was decided to make the Fan Controller an <a href="#observation-analysis">observable entity</a>; in particular the fan controller QActor exposes in its observable status the fan information about the manual/automatic mode, the on/off status and a failure string which assumes significance if there is any failure during the turning on or off of the fan.<br>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Status Aggregator and Manager Controller</h3>
          <div>
            From a careful analysis, it was necessary for this sprint to introduce other two new entities: <k>Status Aggregator</k> and <k>Manager Controller</k>.
          </div>

          <h3 id="status-aggregator-analysis">Status Aggregator</h3>
          <div>
            The goal of the <k>Status Aggregator</k> is to group the information about all observable statuses of the system into a single entity, in order to have a global view of the system and allow the manager to monitor each individual aspect, as asked in the requirements.
            <br>
            To achieve this goal, the Status Aggregator <b>observes each observable entity of the system</b>.
            <br>
            For this reason the Status Aggregator has been modeled as <k>QActor</k>.
            <br><br>
            As already said in the First Problem Analysis for the <a href="../../First%20Problem%20Analysis/userDocs/First%20Problem%20Analysis.html#weight-sensor-costs">weight sensor</a> and for the <a href="../../First%20Problem%20Analysis/userDocs/First%20Problem%20Analysis.html#out-sonar-costs">out sonar</a>, the observation of weight sensor and out sonar entities should be configurable: the managere should be able to start/stop the observation depending on his needs. This configurable observation does not interfer with the observation made by the Indoor Controller and Outdoor Controller.
            <br>
            <b>Note</b> that the moment the weight sensor is observed from both Indoor Controller and Status Aggregator, there are conceptually two observations on the same entity at the same time. But since the Status Aggregator and the Indoor Controller reside in the same qak context, thanks to our <a href="../../First%20Problem%20Analysis/it.unibo.qakobserver/userDocs/Documentation.html">QakObserver framework</a>, the <b>remote observation is <k>AT MOST</k> one</b>, depending on whether there is at least one local entity observing the remote entity. In this way the bandwidth usage is optimized.
            <br>
            The same considerations also apply to outsonar and Outdoor Controller.

            <h4>Observable state</h4>
            <div>
              After a careful analysis, it was decided to make the Status Aggregator an <a href="#observation-analysis">observable entity</a>. <br>
              The information that has to be observable must contain the <b>status of the entire system</b>.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3 id="manager-controller-analysis">Manager Controller</h3>
          <div>
            The task of the Manager Controller is to be an intermediary between the Park Service Status GUI and the domain logic actors like the Transport Trolley, the Fan Controller and the Status Aggregator.
            <br>
            In this way, the Park Service Status GUI has to communicate only with the Manager Controller, that will propagate the messages to the appropriate entities.
            <br><br>
            The Manager Controller has been modeled as a <k>QActor</k>.
          </div>

          <h3 id="park-service-status-gui-analysis">Park Service Status GUI</h3>
          <div>
            The <b>Park Service Status GUI</b> must be an interface that should be used by the manager to administer the PMS.
            <br><br>
            As already analyzed in the <a href="../../First%20Problem%20Analysis/userDocs/First%20Problem%20Analysis.html#park-service-status-gui">First Problem Analysis</a>, a web application can be a valid solution for the realization of the Park Service Status GUI.
            <br><br>
            <div class="in-depth-content">
              So, from this moment, we will analyze the Park Service Status GUI taking into consideration the presence of a <k>web server</k>, which will take care of the communication with the domain logic, and a <k>GUI</k> that will collect manager inputs.
            </div>
            <br>
            The Park Service Status GUI should display the information regarding the <b>status of the system</b>, which should contain:
            <ul>
              <li>the status of the parking slots (free/reserved/occupied);</li>
              <li>the indoor-area status (free/reserved/occupied, weightsensor on/off, weight measured, DTCARENTER alarm);</li>
              <li>the outdoor-area status (free/reserved/occupied, outsonar on/off, distance measured, DTFREE alarm);</li>
              <li>the thermometer status (temperature measured, higher/lower than TMAX);</li>
              <li>the fan status (on/off, manual/automatic, failure);</li>
              <li>the transport trolley status (idle/working/stopped, transportrolley position, move failed);</li>
            </ul>
            In order to be informed every time a change occurs, the Park Service Status GUI should <b>observe</b> the Status Aggregator which contains all the necessary information.
            <br><br>
            Regarding the <k>transfer of the system status between web server and GUI</k>, we have identified several ways. In particular:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Request/response</b>: to obtain the entire system status at once (e.g. a snapshot of the current system situation);</li>
              <li><b>Publish/subscribe</b>: to obtain information only on topics of interest among those listed above.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Note</b>: from an efficiency point of view, as analysts, we suggest the use of the publish/subscribe pattern, in order to reduce the bandwidth usage (since it only receives updates on topics that are actually changed).
            <br><br>
            The GUI should have a button for each operation such as:
            <ul>
              <li>turn the fan on/off;</li>
              <li>set the fan in automatic/manual mode;</li>
              <li>start/stop the Transport Trolley;</li>
            </ul>
            In addition, the manager, using this GUI, must be able to <b>monitor the status of the system</b> and <b>take the proper action when an alarm occurs</b>. For these reasons, the GUI should have also an area where the transport trolley can be visualized (both in terms of WEnv and map form) and an area to display the alarms. The alarm must be clearly visible to the manager and must remain asserted until the issue is handled. A <b>sound</b> can improve the visibility of an alarm.
            <br><br>
            The whole interface must be easy for the manager to understand and use.
          </div>

          <h3 id="mock-data-gui-analysis">Mock Data GUI</h3>
          <div>
            In addition to the considerations made in the <a href="../../Sprint%202%20-%20Car%20Parking/userDocs/sprint2.html#mock-data-gui-analysis">Sprint 2</a>, the <b>Mock Data GUI</b> should allow the manager to change also the temperature measured by the thermometer, in case the thermometer is virtual.
            <br><br>
            This GUI is not specified as a requirement and it is useless in case of a finished product with all real sensors. For that reason no in-depth analysis will be performed.
          </div>

          <h3 id="observation-analysis">About Observation</h3>
          <div>
            The <a href="../../First%20Problem%20Analysis/it.unibo.qakobserver/userDocs/Documentation.html">QakObserver Framework</a> has to be used for each observable entity.
            <br>
            As analysts, we suggest to use <b>JSON</b> as data format, to improve the interaction and the communication, as we indicated also for the sprint 2. Moreover, thanks to <b>Gson or Jackson libraries</b> there's no abstraction gap.
            <br><br>
            Thanks to our <a href="../../First%20Problem%20Analysis/it.unibo.qakobserver/userDocs/Documentation.html">QakObserver Framework</a>, we analyzed <b>three types of observation</b> differentiated by the subject that interrupts the observation itself:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Continuous observation</b>: an entity observes an other entity always;</li>
              <li><b>Component's logic observation</b>: observation started and stopped by a component's logic. An entity observes an other entity only on specific circumstances dictated by the logic of the entity and for limited period of time (e.g. the weight sensor observation made by the Indoor Controller);</li>
              <li><b>Manager input observation</b>: observation initiated and stopped by the manager. Once initialized, the observation is continuous until it is stopped by the manager.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Existing observations are now classified as:

  <h3 id="project-thermometer-configuration">About Thermometer configurability</h3>
  <p>
    In our domain the thermometer is a mock (virtual) one and the input temperature is received by an external dispatch sent by the MockDataGUI. However, since in the future the customer might ask to use a real thermometer we decided to develop a small support able to handle both the real thermometer and the virtual (mock) thermometer. In particular, the class <a href="../it.unibo.automatedcarparking.thermometer/resources/itunibo/automatedcarparking/thermometer/ThermometerSupport.kt">ThermometerSupport.kt</a> can be <k>configured</k> to work with a <k>real</k> thermometer or a <k>virtual</k> one by reading the mode from a configuration file.
    <br><br>
    The system administator can configure the system in order to use the virtual thermometer or the real one by tweak the mode parameter ("virtual" or "real") in the configuration file <a href="../it.unibo.automatedcarparking.thermometer/config_thermometer.json">config_thermometer.json</a>.
    <br><br>
    In both cases (virtual or real mode) the <k>thermometer</k> QActor receives the current temperature by a <k>input_temperature</k> dispatch. <br>
    In case of real thermometer the dispatch could be generated and sent in form of <b>autoMsg()</b> by a thread or coroutine internal to the thermometer. This autoMsg() should be sent by means of <a href="../it.unibo.automatedcarparking.thermometer/resources/itunibo/automatedcarparking/thermometer/RealThermometerSupport.kt">RealThermometerSupport.kt</a> (instantiated by the ThermometerSupport.kt) each time a new temperature is measured in the Parking Area.
    <br><br>
    However, at the time of writing, as per requirements, only the <k>virtual</k> mode has been implemented.

  <h3 id="project-thermometerfilter">About thermometerfilter</h3>
  <p>
    The thermometerfilter is designed as an observable QActor. It interacts with the other entities in the same way as explained in the <a href="#thermometer-filter-analysis">problem analysis</a>. The system administrator can configure the <k>TMAX</k> threshold (in °C) by tweaking the parameter of the configuration file <a href="../it.unibo.automatedcarparking.businesslogic/config_temperature.json">config_temperature.json</a>.

  </p>
  <h3 id="project-statusaggregator">About statusaggregator</h3>
  <p>
    The statusaggregator is designed as an observable QActor. It observes all the observable entities in the Automated Car Parking in order to aggregate the observable status. <br> It makes great use of the <k>qakobserver framework</k>. In particular, as already described in the <a href="#status-aggregator-analysis">problem analysis</a>, thanks to the framework itself, the Proxy resources avoid to duplicate CoAP observation with remote entities (e.g. sensors) - that is, we have multiple observers to remote entities, like weightsensor (e.g. also indoorcontroller observes it), but there is a single CoAP observation shared by all observers (of a given resource) in the ctxbusinesslogic. This feature keeps the required bandwidth constant. <br><br>
    The observation of entities like weightsensor and outsonar is disabled at default but can be enabled/disabled by the manager (through the ParkServiceStatusGUI) at any moment.
    <h4>About observable JSON status</h4>
    <p>
      The same considerations made <a href="#project-about-json-status">here</a> apply.

  </p>
  <h3 id="project-managercontroller">About managercontroller</h3>
  <p>
      The managercontroller is designed as a QActor. It acts like a small indirection layer between the ParkServiceStatusGUI Web Server and the others domain logic actors. Its main behaviour is to forward the dispatches from the ParkServiceStatusGUI to the appropriate domain logic entity.
  </p>
  <h3 id='project-about-json-status'>Considerations about observable JSON status</h4>
  <p>
    The considerations done in <a href="../../Sprint%202%20-%20Car%20Parking/userDocs/sprint2.html#project-about-json-status">Sprint 2</a> are yet valid.
  </p>
  <h3 id="project-parkservicestatusgui-server">ParkServiceStatusGUI Server</h3>
  <p>
    We chose to use <k>Spring Boot</k> to implement the web server that hosts the ParkServiceStatusGUI. The WebServer acts like an intermediate layer between the client and the (domain logic) managercontroller; it is also in charge to <k>observe</k> (via CoAP) the statusaggregator. <br>
    In particular, the WebServer exposes <k>POST APIs</k> that permit to the manager to interact with the (domain logic) managercontroller. If not specified otherwise, each POST API is mapped to a message (dispatch) of those accepted by the managercontroller itself.

    As already discussed, the current status of the Automated Car Parking could be retrieved by means of the <k>/status</k> POST API. However, thanks to the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/stomp.html">STOMP framework</a> we also offer a way to <k>subscribe</k> to specific sub-topics in order to receive updates when a status change occurs. It basically works as like as a <k>publish/subscribe</k> model. The broker is mapped to the <k>/ws</k> URL. <br>

    Note that a client might prefer to register to these topics instead of polling the /status request.

It also subscribe to all the STOMP topics exposed by the Web Server. Each time a status notification arrives the GUI is updated accordingly. Note that in the status are contained also those <k>alarm</k> information: the DTCARENTER timeout, the DTFREE timeout and the TransportTrolley move fail. Each time an alarm becomes asserted we need to properly notify the manager by means of a <k>sound notification</k> and a visible <k>warning message</k> in the GUI itself. The warning message should remain visible until the proper situation has been handled or the manager manually removes it.

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<div class="remark">
  <p>
    The tests have been described in the <a href="#test-plan">above sections</a> and have been implemented <a href="../it.unibo.sprint4.test/test/it/unibo/sprint4/test/TestPlan.kt">here</a>. Each test interacts with the webservers by means of POST requests, so each test simulates the client behaviour.
    <br><br>
    In this sprint we also updated the tests described in <a href="../../Sprint%202%20-%20Car%20Parking/userDocs/sprint2.html#test-plan">Sprint 2</a> and <a href="../../Sprint%203%20-%20Car%20Pick%20Up/userDocs/sprint3.html#test-plan">Sprint 3</a> in order to interact with the Automated Car Parking entities through the ParkServiceStatusGUI. The changes are only those regarding how we send commands to entities and how we retrieve their status; the tests behaviour remain unchanged.
